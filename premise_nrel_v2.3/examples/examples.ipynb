    "With version `2.2.0`, the following transformations are available:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `update(\"biomass\")`: creates regional biomass markets, adjusting the share of residual vs. purpose-grown biomass for use in heat and power generation\n",
    "* `update(\"battery\")`: creates a global mix of stationary and mobile battery technologies.\n",
    "* `update(\"electricity\")`: creates regional electricity markets and adjusts the efficiency of power plants, including that of photovoltaic panels\n",
    "* `update(\"cement\")`: creates regional markets for clinker production and adjusts clinker production efficiency\n",
    "* `update(\"steel\")`: creates regional markets for steel and adjusts steel production efficiency and the supply of secondary steel\n",
    "* `update(\"dac\")` creates region- and scenario-specific inventories for Direct Air Capture (DAC) and Carbon Storage (DACCS) systems.\n",
    "* `update(\"fuels\")`: creates regional markets for liquid and gaseous fuels\n",
    "* `update(\"heat\")`: regionalizes some heat and steam generation datasets (working on diesel, biomass, and natural gas)\n",
    "* `update(\"emissions\")`: adjusts emission of pollutants (PM, NOx, VOCs) for various activities based on GAINS model projections.\n",
    "* `update(\"two_wheelers\")`: imports two-wheelers (bicycles, motorbikes, etc.)\n",
    "* `update(\"cars\")`: produces fleet average cars and relinks to activities consuming passenger car transport\n",
    "* `update(\"trucks\")`: produces fleet average trucks and relinks to activities consuming lorry transport\n",
    "* `update(\"buses\")`: imports buses (urban and coach buses, single-deckers and double-deckers)\n",
    "* `update(\"trains\")`: imports buses (urban and coach buses, single-deckers and double-deckers)\n",
    "* `update(\"external\")`: runs any external scenarios provided.\n",
